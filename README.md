# Syslog parsers for SmartCenter(s)

This is a repository that will contain some parsers I created to parse syslog data into a Check Point SmartCenter.

So far I have created  the following parsers:
- Linux iptables (also works for routers using iptables like the ASUS WRT routers)
- pfSense (only IPv4 at the moment)

I am working a bit on:
- Barracuda Email Security Gateway (could use some help with the email fields in Check Point)
